---LESSON -2 --
	all the data or metadata about previous versions is stored in a repository called .git 
as it starts with a period sign , it is hidden from the users as they dont have to interact with it directly

-COMMIT --
	a commit is a snapshot of a git repository

MAKING A GIT REPOSITORY ---
	git init 
the directory we are in is made the repository.

STATUS OF THE REPOSITORY -
	git status 
returns the status of the last made commits and the rank of current repository

STAGING AREA ---
	there is an area between the actual directory and the it repository in which we can add files and then when we commit only changes to these files are comitted .
this helps us to choose the files from directory which needs to be commited instead of always commiting all the files

ADDING FILES TO STAGING AREA --
	git add 

COMMITING FILES --
	git commit
commits all the files present in staging area .
