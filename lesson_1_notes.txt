Q-- by doing commits manually we can ensure that whenever there ---is a new feature added to the application we can save the file and all of the saved files make sense
---when we are supposed to edit multiple files and the change makes sense together only then it is better to save the changes made in a single commit and git allows that

CLONING A REPOSITORY --
